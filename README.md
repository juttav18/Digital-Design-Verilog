# Verilog Projects Repository

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This space will contain a wide range of Verilog-based projects, spanning from simple combinational circuits to more advanced designs such as RISC processors and pipeline architectures. The goal is to share my journey and expertise in hardware design using Verilog and related tools, focusing on real-world applications in digital design.

## About Me

I am **Veera Venkata Ram Kiran Jutta**, currently pursuing a Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Northeastern University, with a strong foundation in **VLSI Design**, **Digital Systems**, and **Computer Architecture**. I have hands-on experience with industry-standard tools like **Xilinx Vivado** and **Cadence Virtuoso**. With a background in both academia and industry, I have developed a variety of hardware designs, ranging from flight control systems to high-performance microcontrollers.

## What You'll Find Here

This repository will include the following types of Verilog projects:

### 1. **Basic Combinational Circuits**
- Gates, multiplexers, decoders, adders, and more.

### 2. **Sequential Circuits**
- Flip-flops, counters, shift registers, and state machines.

### 3. **Projects**
- More advanced designs, where the concepts from combinational and sequential circuits come together.

### Future Plans
- Expanding to **FPGA-based projects**.
- Providing testbenches and simulations for most designs.
- Including notes and explanations for each design to facilitate learning.

## Technical Skills

I am proficient in:
- **HDL**: Verilog, SystemVerilog
- **Design Tools**: Xilinx Vivado, Cadence Virtuoso, Quartus Prime, ModelSim
- **Programming Languages**: Python, C++
- **Competencies**: Static Timing Analysis, Clock Domain Crossing, RTL Design and Verification, System Design

## Work Experience
