# Verilog Code Repository

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This repository is a growing collection of **Verilog** code that spans a range of topics, from basic combinational circuits to larger projects using Verilog.

## About the Repository

I am in the process of building this repository to showcase various Verilog implementations. The repository will be organized into sections, starting with foundational combinational circuits and gradually progressing to more complex designs. It will serve as a useful resource for students, hobbyists, and professionals interested in hardware design and digital logic.

### What's Included

- **Basic Combinational Circuits**: Simple circuits such as gates, multiplexers, decoders, and adders.
- **Sequential Circuits**: Flip-flops, counters, shift registers, and more.
- **Projects**: More advanced designs, where the concepts from combinational and sequential circuits come together.

### Future Plans

- Expanding to **FPGA-based projects**.
- Providing testbenches and simulations for most designs.
- Including notes and explanations for each design to facilitate learning.
